# xraybinaryorbit

xraybinaryorbit is a user-friendly Python package designed to facilitate the analysis of orbital modulations in X-ray binaries. 

Although orbital modulations are widely known, they are complex to analyze and depend on several parameters and geometrical considerations. With this in mind, we collected all the functions we created through years of analyzing close X-ray binaries and formed a python package useful in almost every X-ray binary analysis, with the aim of facilitating its implementation for other astronomers. With the fact that these orbital modulations rely in several different parameters, here, we propose a user-friendly "form" method to improve the package usability. These forms, once loaded and submited, are saved for future interactions.

Each function is briefly described when loaded, helping to guide its execution.

The primary physics used for these packages rely on the Doppler effect, Kepler's laws, and the CAK model (Castor, Abbott, and Klein) as described in:
Castor, J. I., Abbott, D. C., & Klein, R. I. (1975). Radiation-driven winds in Of stars. *Astrophysical Journal*, 195, 157-174.

This package requires the following Python libraries to function correctly: numpy, pandas, scipy, pyswarm, matplotlib, os, warnings, tkinter, astropy, and inspect. These dependencies cover numerical computations, data manipulation, scientific computing, optimization, visualization, GUI creation, time-series analysis, and interaction with the operating system. Ensure these packages are installed to run this package successfully.

### Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI using `pip`:
pip install xraybinaryorbit

orbital_phase_to_time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Converts orbital phase array to time array for a compact object orbiting a companion star.
    The compact object moves faster at periastron than at apoastro. The increased orbital speed at periastron is primarily due to the conservation of angular momentum, which dictates that as the compact object moves closer to the central star, it must travel faster to maintain the total angular momentum of the system. This relationship is further influenced by Keplerâs laws of planetary motion, which describe how objects sweep out equal areas in equal times and the gravitational force between two bodies, which strengthens as they approach each other and weakens as they move apart.

    Parameters:
    - ph (array-like): Orbital phase array.
    - precision (float, optional): Resolution for the phase array. Default is 0.01.
    - A form will appear to input the necessary orbital parameters. These parameters will be saved in a .txt file in the current directory and automatically loaded in subsequent runs. This avoids the need to re-enter all parameters; you can modify only those that require adjustment.

    Returns:
    - ph (array-like): Orbital phase array (same as input).
    - time (array-like): Time array corresponding to the orbital phase.
    - W (array-like): Angular velocity array corresponding to the orbital phase.

    Inputs:
    - x_data: Time bins of the observed data.
    - y_data: Observed data points corresponding to each time bin.
    - y_err: Error associated with each observed data point (default is 0).
    - units: Units of the observed data (default is "keV").
    - method_: Fitting method to use, either "discrete" or "extended" (default is "extended").
    - extended_binsize: Bin size for extended method (default is 0.01).
    - A form will appear to input the necessary bounds for the orbital parameters. These parameters will be saved in a .txt file in the current directory and automatically loaded in subsequent runs. This avoids the need to re-enter all parameters; you can modify only those that require adjustment.


    Outputs:
    - DataFrame of the best-fit parameters and their errors.
    - ph: Array of phases corresponding to the predicted data.
    - predicted_data: Predicted data based on the best-fit parameters.
    - r_squared: Coefficient of determination (R-squared) indicating the quality of fit.

    fit_nh_ps
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    fit_nh_ps fits the column density (NH1, x 10^22 cm^-2) encountered by radiation emitted at each orbital phase as it travels towards an observer. It assumes a spherically distributed, neutral (unionized) stellar wind based on the CAK model.

    The fitting process uses a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize the chi-squared difference between observed and predicted data points.

    The function supports two fitting methods:

    - Discrete: Suitable for discrete data points (e.g., spectra with small orbital phase ranges, faster).
    - Extended: Suitable for data with varying or extended bin sizes, typical for current instrument resolutions (e.g., XMM-Newton and Chandra) and short X-ray binary (XRB) orbits.

    Inputs:
    - x_data: Time bins of the observed data.
    - y_data: Observed data points corresponding to each time bin.
    - y_err: Error associated with each observed data point (default is 0).
    - num_iterations: Number of iterations for the PSO algorithm (default is 3).
    - maxiter: Maximum number of iterations for each PSO run (default is 200).
    - swarmsize: Number of particles in the PSO swarm (default is 20).
    - method_: Fitting method to use, either "discrete" or "extended" (default is "extended").
    - extended_binsize: Bin size for the extended method (default is 0.01).
    - A form will appear to input the necessary bounds for the orbital parameters. These parameters will be saved in a .txt file in the current directory and automatically loaded in subsequent runs. This avoids the need to re-enter all parameters; you can modify only those that require adjustment.


    Outputs:
    - df_results_transposed: Transposed DataFrame of the best-fit parameters and their standard deviations.
    - ph: Array of phases corresponding to the predicted data.
    - predicted_data: Predicted data based on the best-fit parameters.
    - r_squared: Coefficient of determination (R-squared) indicating the quality of fit.
